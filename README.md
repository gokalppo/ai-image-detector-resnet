**An AI-powered application capable of distinguishing between real photographs and AI-generated images (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney) with high precision.**

## 📖 Project Overview
With the rise of Generative AI, distinguishing between real and synthetic images has become a critical challenge in digital forensics and information verification. 

This project implements a **Deep Learning** solution using **Transfer Learning** on the **ResNet18** architecture. It is trained on the CIFAKE dataset and deployed as a user-friendly web application using **Gradio**.

### ✨ Key Features
* **High Accuracy:** Achieved **99.97%** accuracy on the CIFAKE test set.
* **Transfer Learning:** Utilized pre-trained ResNet18 weights for robust feature extraction.
* **Real-World Robustness:** Implemented a custom pre-processing pipeline to handle the **Domain Shift** between training data (low-res) and real-world images (high-res).
* **Web Interface:** Interactive drag-and-drop interface for real-time testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology

### 1. Model Architecture
* **Backbone:** ResNet18 (Pre-trained on ImageNet).
* **Classifier Head:** Modified Fully Connected layer for binary classification (Real vs Fake).
* **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss.
* **Optimizer:** Adam.

### 2. The "Domain Shift" Challenge 💡
The model was trained on 32x32 images (CIFAKE), but real-world user uploads are often high-resolution. This caused a "Domain Shift" where high-quality real photos were misclassified as AI artifacts.

**Solution:** I engineered a custom transformation pipeline during inference:
1.  **Downsample:** Resize external images to 32x32 (introducing similar artifacts to the training set).
2.  **Upsample:** Resize back to 224x224 for the model input.
This technique significantly improved generalization on external, high-quality photographs.
